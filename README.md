# Links

Welcome to **L1nks**, a simple website designed to gather all your social links in one place, serving as an alternative to platforms like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/).

This project is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Solid](https://solidjs.com/), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed in your development environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
